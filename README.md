# Face_Mask_Detection
This is a face mask detection project which is trained using datasets of two catagories: with mask and without mask. for data preprocessing, datasets are converted into catagorical variable and target size is set to 224, 224. Test size and training size is 20% and 80% respectively. For training the model convolutional neural network is used along with mobileNets. After the input image is processed as array it is sent into the mobileNets after which pooling, flattening and all other procedures are applied as usual to cunstruct the output. the generated model is saved as mask_detector_model along with the plot with the name plot.png. Further this model is used in face detection code for which faceNet is used. Face_detector is also used in this code.
